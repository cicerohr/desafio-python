"""Functions to prevent a nuclear meltdown.

In this exercise, we'll develop a simple control system for a nuclear reactor.

For a reactor to produce the power it must be in a state of criticality. If the
reactor is in a state less than criticality, it can become damaged. If the
reactor state goes beyond criticality, it can overload and result in a
meltdown. We want to mitigate the chances of meltdown and correctly manage
reactor state.
